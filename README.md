# NUTM-for-NLS-on-half-line
This repository contains the codes for computing the solution of the Nonlinear Schrodinger equation on the half-line using the Numerical Unified Transform Method.
The codes depend on the ISTPackage developed by Thomas Trogdon and the RHPackage developed by Sheehan Olver.
